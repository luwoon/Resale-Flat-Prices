# Analysing and Predicting Resale Housing Prices Using Python

In this project, we dive into a dataset of resale housing prices in Singapore (2017-2020) and employ data analysis and machine learning techniques to understand and predict these prices. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.
